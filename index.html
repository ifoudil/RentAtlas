				<p class='paragraphe-home-page'>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
					<br>standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
					<br>it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
